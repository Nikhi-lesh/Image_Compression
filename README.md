# Image_Compression
We often need to transmit and store the images in many applications. Smaller the image, less is the cost associated with transmission and storage.
With this Motivation, we often need to apply data compression techniques to reduce the storage space consumed by the image. One approach is to apply Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) on the image matrix.
